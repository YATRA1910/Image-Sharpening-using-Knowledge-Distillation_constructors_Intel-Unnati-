# Image-Sharpening-using-Knowledge-Distillation_constructors_Intel-Unnati-
 Image Sharpening using Knowledge Distillation | This project explores image deblurring and sharpening using a deep learning approach based on Knowledge Distillation. The goal is to achieve efficient and high-quality image sharpening using a smaller, faster neural network.
! IMPORTANT !
This project uses the Helen dataset for training and evaluating image sharpening models. The dataset is included as a zipped folder: Helen.zip. Kindly unzip it locally to view the data.
